Image-Slide
===========

Simple jQuery plugin for image sliding / fading carousal. 


NOTE:  CSS and LESS files are included for custom styling.  Using LESS is recommended so the height and max-width variables update throughout.  See http://lesscss.org/#usage.  

For the best performance, use the same size for all images in a set and make sure to update the CSS with the proper widths/max-widths for images and containers.


Parameters: 

	data-transition
		Can be either fade or slide

	data-scrollspeed
		Allows for variable speeds on the fade or slide
	
	

NOTE:  Include slider.js or slider-ck.js (minified) file after loading jQuery library.
